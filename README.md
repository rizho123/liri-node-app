## Basic Instructions
##### LIRI Bot currently runs 4 commands:
```
    concert-this
    spotify-this-song
    movie-this
    do-what-it-says
```

##### You can enter in your own artist/song name/movie title after the command like this:

- concert-this **Lady** **Gaga**

- spotify-this-song **Motownphilly**

- movie-this **Fearless**

##### The "do-what-it-says" will read the text inside of "random.txt" and use it to call one of the commands above. By default, the "spotify-this-song" is already written into the file for the song "I Want it That Way."
